# Binary Search Tree Application

This application implements the binary search tree structure using the Java programming language. Binary search tree is a tree structure that is frequently used in data structures and stores data in an orderly manner. In this application, basic operations such as adding nodes to the tree, searching for values, and finding the smallest and largest value are performed. Additionally, breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) navigation methods have also been implemented.

## Features

- Add nodes
- Value search
- Finding the smallest and largest value
- BFS (Breadth First Search) navigation method
- DFS PreOrder (Depth First Search) navigation method
- DFS PostOrder navigation method
- DFS InOrder navigation method
